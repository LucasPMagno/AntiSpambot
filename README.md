# Anti Spam Bot
### (User PM Authentication)

## Synopsis
Basically, this bot allows you to prevent spammers and userbots on Discord. It also makes users more likely to actuslly read the rules. The bot DMs them when they join the server, and then they have to send the bot "yes". That would be like at the bottom of rules, as the message the bot DMs them with says "Please read the rules on the server!", and at the bottom of the rules eould be "DM the bot "yes" to be grsnted talk power. once you reply with "yes, the bot gives you a role (cudtomizeable). If you say "no" or anything else, it kicks you.

## Motivation
This project happened because I was fed up eith scumbags coming on my server and instantly sending messages on how we should join their "amazing" server. So, I began this project.
