# Anti Spam Bot
### (User PM Authentication)

## Credits
Thanks to LucasPMagno for writing this bot and then adding more to it! I also thank him for being lazy and not putting it on GitHub so that I could have all the credit for me before he edited it.

## Synopsis
Basically, this bot allows you to prevent spammers and userbots on Discord. It also makes users more likely to actually read the rules. The bot DMs them when they join the server, and then they have to send the bot "yes". Once you reply with "yes, the bot gives you a specified role. If you say "no", it kicks you.

## Motivation
This project happened because I was fed up eith scumbags coming on my server and instantly sending messages on how we should join their "amazing" server. So, I asked LucasPMagno to do this for me.

## Installation
Installation is easy. Just open up command prompt and follow these steps:
* Type "git clone https://github.com/ACA30/AntiSpambot.git"
* Type "cd AntiSpambot"
* Type "yarn" if this command doesn't work, type "npm install --global yarn". If that command doesn't work, please submit an issue with this repo and we will send help.
* Type "yarn start".
* NOTE: Sadly, you can't fully close the terminal window after starting your bot. You can minimize it.

## Activation
To activate your bot if it goes offline, follow these steps.
* Do "cd AntiSpamBot"
* Do "yarn start"
* Enjoy!

## API Reference
